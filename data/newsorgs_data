The most famous presidential recount was in Florida in 2000, when George W. Bush was 1,784 votes ahead of Al Gore in a state that would determine which of them would be president. More on why recounts rarely change U.S election results https://t.co/ezG33w6NOb by @bradheath 9/9 https://t.co/WK4BOjXsYt
More often, in a recount the winner won by a tiny bit more. On average, they shifted the outcome by 0.024%, Fair Vote found - a vastly smaller margin than Trump would need to overtake Biden in any of the battleground states where he was losing by narrow margins 8/9 https://t.co/gzyGib0VEh
A study last year by the non-partisan group Fair Vote concluded that states had conducted 31 statewide recounts between 2000 and 2019, and that the outcome changed in only three of them 7/9 https://t.co/FeJsIiuLQT
Does it make a difference?NEWLINERecounts rarely upset the results of an election. When they have, it has been in cases in which only a few hundred votes separated the top two candidates 6/9 https://t.co/LehEGVSBgR
Other states like Georgia and Wisconsin allow a losing candidate to force a recount but do not require one. Georgia allows candidates to seek a recount if the margin is less than 0.5%; Wisconsin allows one if it is less than 1% 5/9 https://t.co/eDCnxcrkHI
In Pennsylvania, one of the states pivotal to Biden’s victory, a recount is required if the margin between the winning candidate and the runner-up is less than 0.5% of the votes cast in the election 4/9 https://t.co/RERfppbeAQ
Can Trump get a recount?NEWLINEEvery state sets its own threshold for when to do a recount. Some require one whenever an election is especially close 3/9 https://t.co/6S3gcyRkvt
What is a recount?NEWLINEIn a recount, authorities repeat the process of tallying up votes. They are a relatively common feature of U.S. elections, though rare in presidential contests. States handle recounts differently, but the process mostly comes down to re-tallying the votes 2/9 https://t.co/6NarNrqEfA
President Donald Trump hopes a recount of votes will help keep President-elect Biden out of the White House, but as common as recounts may be, they rarely change the results of U.S. elections and none for a presidential election.
